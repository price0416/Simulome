Simulome takes an existing genome and the corresponding annotation 
information for that genome and samples a subset of the genes to use 
as a simulated genome.  Sampling is performed based read length and 
genes are selected to approximate a normal distribution of read lengths.  
An initial simulation is created by using these sampled genes in 
conjunction with non-duplicating intergenic regions, whose properties 
can be specified by the user.  Once the initial genome is simulated, a 
variant genome can be simulated to meet desired specifications.  
Three run modes are available and can be used in any combination to 
produce variants of the simulated genome containing SNPs, indels, 
and/or duplicate regions.  Additional optional arguments are available 
to allow direct control over selection criteria and genomic structure. 
The resulting simulations will each be provided as a FASTA nucleotide 
file and a GTF/GFF3 annotation file.

For NGS read simulation, we recommend ART. 
Simulome has been tested with ART for complete simulation experiments. 
ART can be found here:

Simulome expects a nucleotide FASTA file and a corresponding GTF/GFF3 annotation
file as input.  Examples of valid input files can be found in the ./sample_data/ folder.


The following are examples of possible simulations.

    Simulate a genome based on e.coli containing 100 genes, output files to a folder called ecoli_simulation/.
      
        python simulome.py -f ecoli_genome.fasta -a ecoli_anno.gtf -o ecoli_simulation -g 100


    Simulate a genome based on e.coli containing 500 genes, and a variant of the simulated genome in which each 
    gene contains 10 SNPs, output to a folder called ecoli_simulation/.

        python simulome.py -f ecoli_genome.fasta -a ecoli_anno.gtf -o ecoli_simulation -g 500 --snp TRUE -s 10


    Simulate a genome based on e.coli containing 500 genes, and a variant of the simulated genome in which each 
    gene contains 10 SNPs that are concentrated in 50 base pair windows, output to a folder called ecoli_simulation/.

        python simulome.py -f ecoli_genome.fasta -a ecoli_anno.gtf -o ecoli_simulation -g 500 --snp TRUE -s 10 -w 50


    Simulate a genome based on e.coli containing 100 genes, and a variant of the simulated genome in which each gene 
    contains an insertion event of length 100, and two deletion events of length 25, output files to a folder called 
    ecoli_simulation/.

        python simulome.py -f ecoli_genome.fasta -a ecoli_anno.gtf -o ecoli_simulation -g 100 --indel 3 -n 100 -m 25 -d 2


    Simulate a genome based on e.coli containing 100 genes, with a variant genome in which each gene contains 5 SNPs, 
    an insertion of length 500, a deletion of length 100, 10% genome duplication, and random intergenic region lengths. 
    Output files to a folder called ecoli_simulation/.

        python simulome.py -f ecoli_genome.fasta -a ecoli_anno.gtf -o ecoli_simulation -g 100 --snp TRUE -s 5 --indel 3 -n 500 -m 100 --duplicate TRUE -c 10
